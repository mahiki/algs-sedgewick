public class UF
             UF(int N)                 initialize union-find data structure with
                                          N objects (0 to N â€“ 1)
        void union(int p, int q)       add connection between p and q
     boolean connected(int p, int q)   are p and q in the same component?
         int find(int p)               component identifier for p
         int count()                   number of components

Note: methods union(p,q), connected(p,q), find(p) operate on integers (0 to N-1)
either construct UF(N+1) or use a converter to go from [1,N] to [0,N-1]
